# Georgia Child Support Guidelines and BCSO Calculation

## Introduction

Georgia's child support guidelines are governed by [O.C.G.A. ยง 19-6-15](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-19/chapter-6/section-19-6-15/), which establishes an "income shares" model for determining child support obligations. This model assumes that the child should receive the same proportion of parental income as they would if the parents were living together. The guidelines aim to ensure fair contributions from both parents based on their incomes, with the presumptive amount derived from the Basic Child Support Obligation (BCSO) table, adjustments, and potential deviations. As of September 2025, the guidelines incorporate updates effective July 1, 2024, including a revised BCSO table reflecting cost-of-living adjustments and a new low-income adjustment table. Parenting time adjustments become mandatory on January 1, 2026.

The calculation process uses official worksheets (Schedules A-E) and can be performed via the [Georgia Child Support Commission's online calculator](https://csconlinecalc.georgiacourts.gov/frontend/web/index.html). Results are presumptive but may be rebutted in court with evidence showing they are unjust or inappropriate.

## Key Definitions (From O.C.G.A. ยง 19-6-15(a))

- **Gross Income**: All income sources, including salaries, wages, commissions, self-employment income (minus business expenses), bonuses, overtime, pensions, interest, dividends, rental income, and benefits like unemployment or workers' compensation. Excludes means-tested public assistance and child support received for other children.
- **Adjusted Income**: Gross income minus deductions for self-employment taxes (half of FICA/Medicare), preexisting child support orders, and theoretical support for other qualified children (if court-approved).
- **Combined Adjusted Income**: Sum of both parents' adjusted incomes.
- **Basic Child Support Obligation (BCSO)**: The base monthly support amount from the statutory table, based on combined adjusted income and number of children.
- **Presumptive Amount**: BCSO prorated between parents, plus adjustments for health insurance and child care.
- **Final Child Support Amount**: Presumptive amount adjusted for deviations, low-income adjustments, and credits (e.g., Social Security or VA benefits paid to the child).

## Step-by-Step BCSO Calculation Process

The calculation follows a structured process using the child support worksheet.

1. **Determine Gross Income for Each Parent (Schedule A)**:  
   Calculate monthly gross income from all sources. Impute income if a parent is unemployed or underemployed without justification (e.g., minimum wage or potential earnings).

2. **Adjust Income (Schedule B)**:  
   Deduct:

   - Half of self-employment taxes (6.2% FICA + 1.45% Medicare).
   - Actual payments for preexisting child support orders (averaged over 12 months).
   - Theoretical support for other qualified children (75% of BCSO for that parent's income and number of children, if court finds hardship).  
     Result: Adjusted gross income per parent.

3. **Calculate Combined Adjusted Income**:  
   Add both parents' adjusted incomes.

4. **Find BCSO from the Table (Schedule C)**:  
   Use the BCSO table to find the base obligation based on combined adjusted income (rounded to nearest $50) and number of children (1-6; for more, use formula in statute). The table ranges from $800 to $40,000 combined monthly income (updated in 2024 for cost-of-living). For incomes over $40,000, courts may apply high-income deviation.

   **Sample BCSO Table Values (2025 Updated, Partial Excerpt)**:  
   | Combined Income | 1 Child | 2 Children | 3 Children | 4 Children | 5 Children | 6 Children |  
   |-----------------|---------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|  
   | $850 | $180 | $275 | $332 | $371 | N/A | N/A |  
   | $900 | $191 | $291 | $351 | $392 | N/A | N/A |  
   | $20,400 | $2,079 | $3,038 | $3,518 | $3,930 | $4,323 | $4,699 |  
   | $40,000 | $3,378 | $5,041 | $5,928 | $6,627 | $7,290 | $7,923 |  
   (Full table available on [Georgia Child Support Commission website](https://csc.georgiacourts.gov/); values reflect 2024 revisions.)

5. **Determine Pro Rata Shares**:  
   Each parent's percentage = Their adjusted income / Combined adjusted income.  
   Multiply BCSO by each percentage to get each parent's basic share.

6. **Add Additional Expenses (Schedule D)**:

   - Health insurance premiums (child's portion only).
   - Work-related child care costs (monthly average).  
     Prorate these between parents; credit the paying parent.  
     Result: Presumptive child support amount (noncustodial parent's obligation).

7. **Apply Deviations and Adjustments (Schedule E)**:  
   Court may deviate if presumptive amount is unjust, with written findings on child's best interest and impact. Types:

   - **Low-Income Adjustment**: For noncustodial parents earning $1,550-$3,950/month, use sliding scale table to reduce obligation (new in 2025; ensures self-support reserve while considering custodial household).
   - **High-Income Deviation**: For combined income >$40,000/month.
   - **Parenting Time Deviation**: Discretionary until 2026; based on overnights (e.g., reduction for >92 days/year). Mandatory formula in 2026.
   - **Specific Deviations**: Extraordinary education/medical expenses (>7% of BCSO), travel costs, etc.
   - Credits: Social Security/VA benefits paid to child.

8. **Final Amount and Duration**:  
   Noncustodial parent pays final amount to custodial parent. Support continues until child is 18 (or 20 if in high school), marries, or emancipates.

## Special Cases

- **Split Parenting**: Separate calculations if children live with different parents.
- **Uninsured Health Expenses**: Allocated pro rata or as court orders.
- **Modifications**: Possible if significant change in income or needs.

## 2025 Updates

- Revised BCSO table with higher maximum income ($40,000) and inflation adjustments.
- New low-income adjustment table.
- VA disability credits added.
